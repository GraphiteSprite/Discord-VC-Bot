# Discord VC Bot

This is our submission for the OpenAI Whisper Hackathon.

We created a discord bot in python that listens to user input in a voice call, transcribes the audio using Whisper, and then creates a response using GPT-3, which is generated into text-to-speech using the Uberduck API and played back into the voice call.
